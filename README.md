# Design and Modeeling of Gallium Oxide-based FET Project

## Project Overview
This project involves modeling and simulating Ga2O3-based FET structures to analyze the effects of metal contacts and dielectric changes. We ran over 50 simulations to gather data and analyzed the results.

## Data
The simulation results are stored in the `/data` folder. The data includes results in Excel format, with various parameters and simulation outcomes.

## Scripts
The analysis and visualization scripts are stored in the `/scripts` folder. You can run these scripts to replicate the analysis and generate charts from the data.

## Instructions
To use the scripts:
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/narendrankumaravel/Design-and-Modelling-of-Gallium-Oxide-FET.git`
2. Install the required Python libraries.
3. Run the analysis script: `python scripts/analysis.py`
